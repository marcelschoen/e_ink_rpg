# EInk RPG

This is an attempt to develop a small RPG-like game that is playable on e-ink Android devices.
As e-ink isn't well suited for animations, this game has none, only static images, icons etc.,
and it also is not implemented using a game engine; instead, is is built with Google's Flutter
widget framework and the Dart programming language.

## Game Scope

The game is meant to be a simple monster hunter game where the player completes jobs that will
consist mostly of monster attack waves.

## Turn-Based Combat

Of course e-ink devices lend themselves well to turn-based combat systems, since they require 
no animations.

## e-ink what and why?

I wanted to have a game that is playable well on my Onyx e-ink device, with slightly more depth
and complexity than a Sudoku or Reversi app. As I love turn-based RPGs like the Trails or Persona
games, I thought something like that should work well enough on an e-ink display, so there you go.

## Compatibility

The game is developed and tested on Onyx Nova 3 Color and Buoye Mars Likebook T-800 (for now). It
should run on any tablet running Android 6 or newer, and with a resolution of around 1400x1800.

## License / Free ??

This game is 100% free, with no in-game purchases or ads. It is also Open Source - available on
Github under the very permissive Apache 2.0 license. Meaning you can take the source and do with
it whatever you want, including building your own game from it, and then selling that game for 
money; there is just one BIG, IMPORTAN caveat to consider in that case:

### IMPORTANT: Non-free assets 

There are quite a few game assets (graphics etc.) that were purchased from sites like itch.io,
and which are NOT free. So if you want to create your own game based on this project, it either
has to be free too, or you will have to purchase the graphics assets yourself (or replace them).
