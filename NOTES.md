# Development stuff

* Flutter refactoring shortcut: ALT + ENTER

## To Dos / Next

* Equip screen
* "Equip" button in inventory screen
** Disable "Discard" etc. buttons for equipped items

## Ideas 

* Ability to send out spies to search for certain enemies or items, will reveal location / unlock job?
* Use summons to get temporary allies
** Might be displayed on the side for a few turns
** Might have perks and/or buffs that also transfer over to the player (e.g. elemental affinity)
** Might randomly take actions of their own
** Act on their own during enemy turn
* Add mounts and/or pets as allies that also act on their own during enemy turn
  and provide perks / buffs.
* Knock-Down mechanic a la Persona: Knock down an enemy gives you an immediate additional turn;
  following that up with an AoE that knocks down all other enemies too gives yet another turn.
* Equip screen provides list of loadouts
* Sniping mechanism with ranged weapons? When discovering enemies during exploration but still outside combat
* Stealth minigame when raiding enemy camp?

# Day / Night cycle

* Each attack wave may represent a certain amount of time, e.g. 1 hour.
* Time of day is shown somewhere on top, possibly in appbar
* Possibility to wait until morning / evening
* Random attack waves at night have stronger enemies but also better loot
** Possibly also different enemies, i.e. undead and ghosts that do not appear during day

# Non-combat activities

All of those might also give some XP

* Cooking
** Might require finding recipes
* Fishing
** Maybe needs bait / different types of bait for different catches 
** Might allow to randomly fish out items (see Minecraft)
* Gardening


# Overarching Goals / Endgame Ideas

* Trophies – collect all monsters
* Rare Artifacts – collect them all -> Maybe one per region? 
* Kill the highest leader of the Orc army -> Mercenaries-like structure, maybe mixed in with Nemesis-style system
 * Maybe kill highest leader of each region -> once all regions are unlocked, and all their leaders slain, unlock final Orc General/King boss fight.
* Unlock all locations -> maybe map consists of multiple regions, and each region has several locations -> complete all regions (new regions could be added with future updates)
* Zoo: Capture two of each animal/monster (only non-humanoid monsters) alive for zoo
* Fully build your player home (main house, garden, stables…)
  * Each part requires adding drainage (protects against floods), lightning rods (lightning may cause fire with partial damage), steel fortifications (against partial damage through storms)

# Quest Ideas

* Quest types: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(video_games)
* Combo quests -> quests with infinite attack waves?
* Acquiring a new skill requires not just a certain level, but also maybe performing a certain combo
* Maybe start such quests from the skills tree screen?
* Collection quests: Keep killing monsters of certain types to collect certain materials for traders / smiths etc.
* Kill quests: Attack and certain mini-boss enemies (multiple waves, last wave is mini boss fight)
* Fetch / Delivery quests / maybe these quests provide more money the larger the delivery/fetch distance -> would go well with expandable map
* Escort quests (same as fetch/delivery quests in regards to distances)
* Defense quests -> horde-mode like defense of a location; many attack waves, no bosses
* Siege quests? Same as defense quests, only to unlock a new location (fortress)
* Special Quests
** Hunt NPC over multiple quests -> collect a riddle at the end of the quest that must be solved to get the follow-up quest
* Endless hunting / collection quest
** Allows to continue job after every 5 waves or so
** Collects plants / attacked only by animals (usually)

# Surprise Ideas

Surprises may be disabled entirely for a while at the start of the game, so that the player first
can get aquainted with the "normal" gameplay routine.

* Chance encounters during jobs (between attack waves) with NPCs
* While in the shop, the player is suddenly attacked by “bandit”, “thief” and “thug” NPCs -> receive special reward from shop owner
* Sudden weather condition changes can inflict damage during combat (lightning, rain weaking fire enemies or strengthening water enemies)
* Rescue quest turns into boss fight when rescued NPC turns out to be villain
* Random Bandit attacks -> maybe also solvable with dialogue tree
* Random attacks on unlocked location -> trigger defense quest
* Hired NPC turns on player / is in bed with bandits from quest

# Difficulty levels

Things to adjust according to difficulty level:

* Saving after every attack wave / restart job from checkpoint
* Hires get half of loot / half of money
* Obviously combat aspects (damage, defense)
