# Development stuff

* Flutter refactoring shortcut: ALT + ENTER

## Ideas 

* Use summons to get temporary allies
** Might be displayed on the side for a few turns
** Might have perks and/or buffs that also transfer over to the player (e.g. elemental affinity)
** Might randomly take actions of their own
** Act on their own during enemy turn
* Add mounts and/or pets as allies that also act on their own during enemy turn
  and provide perks / buffs.
* Knock-Down mechanic a la Persona: Knock down an enemy gives you an immediate additional turn;
  following that up with an AoE that knocks down all other enemies too gives yet another turn.
*
